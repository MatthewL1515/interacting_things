The objects that I plan on using will be a cannon (using the startShape and endShape code) and a cannonball. I want the 'cannon' to shoot the cannonball in a randomly determined direction (using random() code). To find when the cannonball collides with the cannon, I intend to use the x and y positions of the outside of the cannonball referencing the x and y positions of the outside of the cannon (size of cannon circle + x-position of cannon determines the position of the edge). When the cannonball collides with the cannon, the cannon and cannonball disappear (or get. destroyed). Then, the cannon reappears at a new random location on the canvas (attributing a new random number to x and y within the canvas) and fires a new cannonball. However, an important item to mention is that the cannon will not move, instead, the cannonball will be moving in a random direction determined by using values dx and dy. When the edge of the cannonball touches the canvas, it will reverse direction by using a dx *= -1 or dy *= -1. The cannonball will begin moving from outside of the cannon to ensure it does not touch the cannon. Also, the variable dx of the cannonball being fired will be a random number >= 0, as I do not intend for the cannon the fire the cannonball into itself (I want the cannon fire to be facing right, so when it fires the cannonball must either fly up, down, or in a vector moving right).
