In this assignment, I utilized objects instead of many variables for better organization and readability. Although I did have some challenges with using the objects in the beginning, I did find that using the return() function helped immensely with assigning random values to objects. Instead of editing the code piece by piece, I rewrote entire sections. One thing I noticed was that I didn't need to write two separate boundary checks for the different circles, and I now realize that this is because of the new code with objects. I'm proud of how much I was able to consolidate my code (earlier it was 113 lines, now it's 90 lines). Using objects instead of creating variables would require many more lines of code, but using objects within functions can make it much easier to organize.
